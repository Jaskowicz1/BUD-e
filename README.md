# BUD-e
The BUD-e Discord Bot, rewrote in C++!
Updates will be made frequently.

BUD-e' is automated via Jenkins and will update locally every git push, however, this does not update the bot whilst running.
BUD-e will update on discord when he's flagged to do so. BUD-e has two versions:

- Experimental
- Stable

These are different bots. The Experimental version is a bot that is only ever online when running locally. Stable is the official "BUD-e" bot.
Experimental also serves as a testing ground for D++ contributions.

## Libraries

- D++ (Follow [Installation Guide](https://dpp.dev/9.0.2/buildcmake.html) to install. Put the "libs" folder with every other folder).
