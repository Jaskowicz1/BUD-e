# BUD-e
The BUD-e Discord Bot, rewrote in C++! BUD-e also serves as a testing ground for the D++ docs.
Updates will be made frequently.

BUD-e' is automated via Jenkins and will update locally every git push, however, this does not update the bot whilst running.
BUD-e will update on discord when he's flagged to do so. Soon, BUD-e will have two versions:

- Experimental
- Stable

These versions will be different bots. Experimental will be updated nightly.

## Libraries

- D++ (Follow [Installation Guide](https://dpp.dev/9.0.2/buildcmake.html) to install. Put the "libs" folder with every other folder).
